Hi everyone, this is one of those questions that has always caused me a bit of confusion, especially when the text is being translated for a general u.s. If you say 'beat my high score!' you think that your score is high and you are inviting someone to beat it. Hi for these two choices, which one is correct ? Could you tell me the differences when using these phrases rank first and rank the highest. I looked for the old threads;</p>
