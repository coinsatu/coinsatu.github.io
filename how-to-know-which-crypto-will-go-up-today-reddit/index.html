            </p><p>I want to say “my advisor has been very helpful, from helping me decide which classes to take to letting me know/telling me about the resources available to me”. It's not just you that don't know. However, i am having trouble figuring out why (or whether) this is the correct way to write the sentence, as opposed. Possibly, i do know that can in fact only be used, when, you are answering the question of whether or not you know the issue at hand (or your knowledge has been called in to question, and. In the first sentence, it seems to me that to know expresses that the speaker experienced the problem/difficulty before. Do is the present tense, so saying do you know would ask if you currently know. Please let me know as soon as you figure it out. Therefore, saying did you know asks if you have previously known something.</p>

        <p>I saw this sentence in the book 1q84: Alright, well, for example, like on saturdays, y’know, what i liked to do. In the first sentence, it seems to me that to know expresses that the speaker experienced the problem/difficulty before.

        <p>Can it be used in formal conversation/writing? Please let me know as soon as you figure it out. Recently one of my friends told me that there is distinct difference between 'know of something' and 'know about something' expressions. Do is the present tense, so saying do you know would ask if you currently know.</p>
