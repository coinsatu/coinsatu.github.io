I looked for the old threads; This phrase is from a formal letter please who can send some translation for this phrase write to me as soon as possible Could you tell me the differences when using these phrases rank first and rank the highest. Hi for these two choices, which one is correct ? I would like to know a natural way of writing this on my cv:</p>

        <p>I looked for the old threads; No, a high score is a high score. I had the highest grades/gpa among other students in my major (bachelor of science in finance). Sydney ranked first in terms of the price of a cup of coffee.</p>

        <p>I found one but that is not. Is the award given to the person who got the highest grade/marks for his or her thesis? If you say 'beat my high score!' you think that your score is high and you are inviting someone to beat it. Hi everyone, this is one of those questions that has always caused me a bit of confusion, especially when the text is being translated for a general u.s.</p>

        <p>L learned in this forum that i should say something remained highest insteand of the highest, so i wonder if the verb &#039;is&#039; follows the same rule, since &#039;remain&#039; and &#039;is&#039; are the same.
