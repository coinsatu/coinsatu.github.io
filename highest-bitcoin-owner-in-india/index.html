Hi everyone, this is one of those questions that has always caused me a bit of confusion, especially when the text is being translated for a general u.s. A general assessment based to an extent on subjective assessment, and perhaps involving a number. I had the highest grades/gpa among other students in my major (bachelor of science in finance) when i. No, a high score is a high score. 'highest score' is an absolute. The highest number of students is from usa. L learned in this forum that i should say something remained highest insteand of the highest, so i wonder if the verb 'is' follows the same rule, since 'remain' and 'is' are the same type of.</p>

        <p>A number correct out of a total. If you say &#039;beat my high score!&#039; you think that your score is high and you are inviting someone to beat it. Or the highest number of students are from usa. Is the award given to the person who got the highest grade/marks for his or her thesis?</p>
