            </p><p>While are you feeling better refers to someone, let's say, who catches a cold and the next day you raise the question are you feeling. You can certainly say that, effect3. What's the difference between these? Maybe it's better doing things the way everyone does. 2.it will be better to tell her the truth. Better in you better do it now is replacing had better in you had better do it now. it thus is an adjective turned into a verb, just as much as shovel (originally used only as a noun). Whether you use the less the better, the fewer the better or the smaller the better depends on what adjective fits for the noun that you are talking about. If so, what‘s the difference.</p>

        <p>What&#039;s the difference between these? My mother is now cooking meat in the kitchen. Better in you better do it now is replacing had better in you had better do it now. it thus is an adjective turned into a verb, just as much as shovel (originally used only as a noun). I want to give her my suggestion on the food.</p>

        <p>If so, what‘s the difference. 1.“mom, it would be better if you added some sugar to the meat. 2.“mom, it would be better if. The best is not wrong when comparing just two, but the better makes clear that the comparison is. Better can be used as a verb to replace improve with the same meaning.</p>
