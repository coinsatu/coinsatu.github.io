            </p><p>Severe and repetitive childhood trauma often causes dissociative identity disorder (did). Kepribadian ganda atau gangguan did adalah kondisi mental langka yang memengaruhi identitas seseorang. Disturbed and altered sleep has also been suggested as having a role in dissociative disorders in general and specifically in did. If you have did, you may find yourself doing things you wouldn't normally do, such as speeding, reckless driving, or stealing money from your employer or friend. Did is strongly associated with early childhood trauma, chronic emotional neglect, or repeated distress that overwhelms a developing brain’s capacity to cope. They may also find themselves in different places from where they last remember being and have no idea why or how they got there. You can have multiple identities that function independently if you have did. Alterations to environments are also said to affect did.</p>
