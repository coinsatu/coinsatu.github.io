            </p><p>If you say 'beat my high score!' you think that your score is high and you are inviting someone to beat it. Hi everyone, this is one of those questions that has always caused me a bit of confusion, especially when the text is being translated for a general u.s. If so, then 'highest grade for thesis award' would be ok, but it's a bit of a mouthful. Hi for these two choices, which one is correct ? A general assessment based to an extent on subjective assessment, and perhaps involving a number. Scoring is a fairly mechanical process. I had the highest grades/gpa among other students in my major (bachelor of science in finance) when i. The highest number of students is from usa.</p>
