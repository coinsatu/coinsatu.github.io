            </p><p>The highest number of students is from usa. What was the highest grade you completed at that level of school. L learned in this forum that i should say something remained highest insteand of the highest, so i wonder if the verb 'is' follows the same rule, since 'remain' and 'is' are the same type of. If so, then 'highest grade for thesis award' would be ok, but it's a bit of a mouthful. If you say 'beat my high score!' you think that your score is high and you are inviting someone to beat it. I had the highest grades/gpa among other students in my major (bachelor of science in finance) when i. Scoring is a fairly mechanical process. What was the highest class you completed at that level of school ?</p>
