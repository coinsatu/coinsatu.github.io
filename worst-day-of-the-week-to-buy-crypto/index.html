            </p><p>Oda has actually done this very nicely with rocks and harald (and i've criticized his writing often lately). And if thor is anywhere near her it’s obviously his fit iw one and not the previous weaker ones Harald &gt; greenbull is definitely up there among the worst takes and worst displays of illiteracy i have ever encountered. Some of the worst takes are: Oda shows that (political) extremes only lead to a quick and ugly downfall. Probably dressesrosa simply because doflamingo was a great villain which helped make the arc fun to read worst:fishman island the arc minus the fisher tiger flashback felt like oda. I believe the message oda wants to send through this backstory was over relying on one thing is bad. The strangest thing about everything that happened.</p>

Probably dressesrosa simply because doflamingo was a great villain which helped make the arc fun to read worst:fishman island the arc minus the fisher tiger flashback felt like oda. The bloke oozes pure classic villain aura and was the first big threat to the protagonist in the story. And that harald should've balanced between a peaceful route and military might.</p>
