            </p><p>Hello, does this question are you working today? mean either are you going to work today? or are you at work at present? (without a context, i just wonder what it means generally.). Every time i hear them say it, i wonder if it is correct to use the. In my town, people with phd's in education use the terms, on today and on tomorrow. i have never heard this usage before. In the sentences i gave as examples, “by today “could mean yesterday, or last week. 2) as of today, all passengers must check their luggage before boarding the plane. “today” would mean i was still working on it today. Today class would be a type of class that occurs today. Hence is is correct to say today it is saturday.</p>

        <p>Today it's sauturday = today it is saturday today is saturday as today is a moving and variable thing it can be any day of the week. Hello, does this question are you working today? mean either are you going to work today? or are you at work at present? (without a context, i just wonder what it means generally.). “today” would mean i was still working on it today. 2) as of today, all passengers must check their luggage before boarding the plane.</p>

    <br/>
        <p>Since the point you are trying to convey is that the assumption you made yesterday is no longer valid, the. Tomorrow&#039;s class will be the same type of class as today&#039;s class so it doesn&#039;t actually identify a different type of class. Hence is is correct to say today it is saturday. Today means the current day, so if you&#039;re asking what day of the week it is, it can only be in present tense, since it&#039;s still that day for the whole 24 hours.</p>
