        <p>Hi for these two choices, which one is correct ? The highest number of students is from usa. Could you tell me the differences when using these phrases rank first and rank the highest. Is the award given to the person who got the highest grade/marks for his or her thesis?</p>

        <p>If so, then &#039;highest grade for thesis award&#039; would be ok, but it&#039;s a bit of a mouthful. Or the highest number of students are from usa.
