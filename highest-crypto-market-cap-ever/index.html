Could you tell me the differences when using these phrases rank first and rank the highest. I looked for the old threads; A number correct out of a total. If you say 'beat my high score!' you think that your score is high and you are inviting someone to beat it. Scoring is a fairly mechanical process. No, a high score is a high score. If so, then 'highest grade for thesis award' would be ok, but it's a bit of a mouthful.</p>
